This repository contains my deep learning course projects as part of the Deep Learning course at Ben Gurion University of The Negev.  </br>
During the course I have implemented 4 projects, in which each one covers different approach - ANN, CNN, RNN and GAN. </br>
The first lessons of the course were based on Coursera's course of Andrew Ng. - DeepLearning Specialization ([link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)) and covered all of its sylabus. Next lessons were about current work on this field of study and open challenges.

The porjects were implemented in python 3.7, using Tensorflow library version 2.6 and Keras API.

## Projects
1. ANN - the purpose of the project was to build a simple neural network “from scratch” and to obtain a deep understanding of the forward/backward propagation process (without using tensorflow or keras)

2. CNN - Facial Recognition using One-shot Learning - This work is based in the paper [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf). The purpse was to successfully execute a one-shot learning task for previously unseen objects. Given two facial images of previously unseen persons, the architecture have to successfully determine whether they are the same person.

3. RNN - lyrics generation using RNNs - The purpose of this task was to train a neural network to generate lyrics based on a provided melody.

4. GAN - Tabular samples generation - This work has two sections, the first one is an implementation of a simple GAN model for tabular data, and the second part is an implementaion of a GAN architecture that should infer the inner-working of a black-box model.
